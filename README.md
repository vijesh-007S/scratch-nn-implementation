🧠 Scratch Neural Network Implementation

Welcome to scratch-nn-implementation – a from-the-ground-up implementation of a basic neural network built entirely from scratch using Python, with no external deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

This project is designed to demystify the inner workings of neural networks by manually coding all core components — from forward propagation and activation functions to backpropagation and gradient descent.

🚀 Features

Pure Python implementation (no high-level ML libraries)

Support for multi-layer feedforward neural networks

Customizable architecture (layers, neurons, learning rate, etc.)

Implemented activation functions: Sigmoid, ReLU, etc.

Basic loss functions (e.g., MSE)

Step-by-step training using backpropagation

Easy to extend and experiment with

📚 Educational Goals

Developers who prefer hands-on learning over abstract libraries

Anyone interested in building foundational AI skills
